    definition: |
      <p>Static application security testing (SAST) is a type of security testing that relies on inspecting the source code of an application. In general, SAST involves looking at the ways the code is designed to pinpoint possible security flaws.</p>      
      <p>SAST is often contrasted with another term that is, in some ways, opposite to it: dynamic application security testing (DAST). The difference between these two is that, with SAST, testers read the source code. They look for logical flaws, such as a loophole in data control, something that a hacker could use to gain access to the system. In contrast, in DAST, testers do not look at the source code but perform behavioral testing instead — they run the application and look for flaws that way.</p>      
      <p>IT experts also differentiate between the two using the terms "white box testing" and "black box testing." SAST is white box testing because the source code for the application is available and transparent. That is what testers look at. In contrast, DAST is black box testing because the source code is not part of the equation. Instead, black box testers rely solely on the behavior of the application.</p>

  - focus: "Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)"
    definition: |
      <p>Dynamic application security testing (DAST) is a process of testing an application or software product in an operating state. This kind of testing is helpful for industry-standard compliance and general security protections for evolving projects.</p>      
      <p>Typically, IT professionals contrast dynamic application security testing (DAST) with another type of testing, static application security testing (SAST). Whereas DAST involves operational testing, SAST involves looking at the source code and theorizing about security vulnerabilities or spotting design and construction flaws with potential for vulnerability. Moreover, DAST may be called "behavioral testing" in that testers often find problems that are not specifically linked to a code module, but happened during use. The task then is to trace them back to their roots in terms of the software design.</p>      
      <p>Tech companies offer both DAST and SAST services. Typically, these cover different types of ground in comprehensive testing processes — for example, DAST may only cover certain parts of the interface or design. Using DAST and SAST in combination can help catch different types of security problems before a product is released or develops a growing user base.</p>

    definition: |
      <p>Software composition analysis (SCA) is an open source component management tool. It generates a report listing all open source components in a given product – including direct and indirect dependencies. Using an SCA, a development team can quickly track and analyze any open source component brought into a project.</p>      
      <p>A SCA solution allows for the secure risk management of open source use throughout the software supply chain, allowing the security team and developers to create an accurate Bill of Materials (BOM) for all your applications, discover and track all open source, Set and enforce policies, enable proactive and continuous monitoring. and seamlessly integrate open source code scanning into the build environment.</p>

      <p>Container security tools will help scanning container images, VM images, and functions for known vulnerabilities, embedded secrets, malware, configuration issues, and over-provisioned permissions, integrating directly to the CI pipeline, as well as into registries or function stores. Additionally, they can detect and prevent images with hidden malware that evade static scanning from being deployed in production environments, and "shifts left" incident response.</p>

    definition: |     
      <p>Because both SAST and DAST are older technologies, there are those who argue they lack what it takes to secure modern web and mobile apps. For example, SAST has a difficult time dealing with libraries and frameworks found in modern apps. That’s because static tools only see the application source code they can follow. What’s more, libraries and third­party components often cause static tools to choke, producing “lost sources” and “lost sinks” messages. The same is true for frameworks. Run a static tool on an API, web service or REST endpoint, and it won’t find anything wrong in them because it can’t understand the framework.</p>
      <p>IAST is designed to address the shortcomings of SAST and DAST by combining elements of both approaches. IAST places an agent within an application and performs all its analysis in the app in real-time and anywhere in the development process ­­ IDE, continuous integrated environment, QA or even in production.</p>
      <p>Because the IAST agent is working inside the app, it can apply its analysis to the entire app ­­ all its code; its runtime control and data flow information; its configuration information; HTTP requests and responses; libraries, frameworks and other components; and backend connection information. Access to all that information allows the IAST engine to cover more code, produce more accurate results and verify a broader range of security rules than either SAST or DAST.</p>
